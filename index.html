    <h2>Projects</h2>
    
  <li> <b> <em> IoT Smart Pill Dispenser, Lead Designer
</em></b> -  <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rumi-alkhani/"> Project </a>

<ul> <li>
Worked with a team to design a smart pill dispenser using a horizontal disc mechanism to release one pill per day with cloud-enabled monitoring. Integrated Ultrasonic and Active IR sensors for precise pill detection and alignment, and programmed the system in Arduino IDE interconnected with Labview to optimize motor control and sensor accuracy. Delivered a reliable, user-focused prototype by driving design decisions, testing, and overall project design and leadership </ul></li>
  
  <li> <b> <em> Object-Oriented Payroll Management System, programmer
</em></b> -  <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/masterboatman/1PR3-OOP-Project"> Github </a>

<ul> <li>  Object-Oriented Payroll Management System (c++)

Utilized C++ object-oriented programming to create software to record employee payroll information. The software utilized Console IO to create a UI for ease of use. </ul></li>
  
 <ul><li> Included in the software is a credit card validator which utilizes the Luhn Algorithm to verify that given details are valid. The software was for the culminating project in ENGTECH 1PR3: Object-Oriented Programming, yielding a grade of 98%. </ul></li>
  
  <li> <b> <em> Perpetua, Designer/Coordinator
</em></b> -  <a rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Rumi999/Perpetua"> Github </a>

<ul> <li>  

Perpetua is a RPG video game where you play as an unknown protagonist lost in a mysterious world. You must navigate your surroundings while fighting various enemies in order to escape. The game involves puzzle solving, RPG elements, and a well-built story with multiple endings. </ul></li>

<ul><li> All artwork was designed by the team with the exception is the main character sprite, which was public domain and was modified prior to being added </ul></li>
